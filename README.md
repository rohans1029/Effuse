# Effuse
Pleural effusion is a common lung disorder which can be dissected into two main categories: transudates and exudates. Initially, pleural effusion is diagnosed using X-rays or CT scans. Once effusion can be spotted on one of these scans, a pleural fluid tap-an invasive procedure-is coducted to identify the nature of the effusion--either transudate or exudate. Before this procedure, and ultrasound is used to mark where the fluid is located. These sonograms can be used to identify the nature of pleural effusion without the invasive procedure. However, it is hard for a radiologist-human-to differentiate between the two accurately. Thus, a effuse was made: a machine learning algorithm for differential diagnosis in transudate and exudate pleural effusion.
